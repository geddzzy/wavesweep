## Features

- **AP Discovery**: Detects nearby access points and client devices
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identifies weak protocols (WEP, WPS) and misconfigurations
- **Rogue AP Detection**: Compares against a trusted baseline to identify unauthorized devices
- **Signal Mapping**: Visualizes signal strength and vulnerability distribution (Linux only)
- **Offline Operation**: No internet connection required
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates text or HTML reports with security findings
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux (full features) and Windows (limited to connected AP info)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/geddzzy/wavesweep.git
    cd wavesweep
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **(Linux only) Put your wireless interface in monitor mode:**
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
    ```

    > **Note:** On Windows, monitor mode is rarely supported. You can still audit your currently connected Wi-Fi network.

## Usage

```bash
# Linux (recommended for full features)
sudo python wavesweep.py [options]

# Windows (limited: only info about connected Wi-Fi)
python wavesweep.py [options]
```

### Options:
- `-i INTERFACE` : Wireless interface (default: wlan0mon on Linux, Wi-Fi on Windows)
- `-d DURATION`  : Scan duration in seconds (default: 30)
- `-r {text,html}` : Report format (default: text)
- `-v`           : Generate network visualization (Linux only)
- `-u`           : Update AP baseline with current scan

### Example:
```bash
sudo python wavesweep.py -i wlan0mon -d 45 -r html -v -u
```

## Platform Support & Limitations

- **Linux:** Full feature set, including monitor mode scanning, AP/client discovery, and visualization.
- **Windows:** Only information about the currently connected Wi-Fi network is available. Most Wi-Fi cards do not support monitor mode on Windows.
